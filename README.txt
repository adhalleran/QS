This is the online repository for data and analysis accompanying the paper "Cell-free and in vivo characterization of LuxR, LasR, and RpaR activation systems." 

All data files, raw and tidy'd versions, can be found in the "Data" directory. 

A jupyter notebook that reproduces all figures presented in the publication is available. Anaconda 3.5 is the only requirement for running the notebook.
